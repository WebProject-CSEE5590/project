# Tunelink

## Project Description

TuneLink is a web app designed to generate musical event listings based on user preferences. Those preferences can be used to search for events either by location, by a particular artist, or by using a Spotify account ID.s

## Motivation

Finding a msical event to attend often involves having to visit multiple websites that either cater to an artist or a venue which can prove to be very time-consuming. TuneLink attempts to overcome this by using APIs to bring all relevant information to a single interface.u

## How to Run TuneLink
TuneLink is currently hosted locally. 
<ol>
    <li>Clone this repository and from the tunelink directory run `ng serve`.</li>
    <li>Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`</li>
</ol>
